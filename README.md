This is version 2 of my personal blog. I'm using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) to build my site. I deployed my site to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and I'm using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to store contact messages, and in the future comments and authentication.

## Changes from the first blog.

The first blog was created using NextJS and javascript. Now I have rebuilt the site using NextJS and TypeScript. I am also using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the site.
